# Pyrogram Dark Docs

Ever got your eyes burned out by a bright UI?

Fear no more, here's a [UserCSS] for you to enjoy. Built with inspiration from [PyTorch Dark][PyTorch] but re-written from scratch.

# Installation

1. Install [Stylus]
2. Open the [UserCSS file](pyrogram-dark-docs.user.css)
3. Click on "Raw" above the code
4. Click on "Install Style" on the left

Instead of Stylus you can also go with [Stylish]. I don't know if they work exactly the same, so be aware of potential differences.
Please note that Stylish is known for [sending your entire brower history over to their own servers][StylishTech].
